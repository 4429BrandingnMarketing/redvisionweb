8. **Contact** (`contact.js`) - Contact information and form

## AI Integration
The website has been developed with a comprehensive AI integration concept that positions Red Vision Creative Studio as the first AI-powered lifestyle agency. Key AI features include:

1. **AI Executive Structure** - Specialized AI systems function as department heads, managing teams of task-specific AI assistants
2. **Cross-Division Intelligence** - Data and insights flow seamlessly between divisions
3. **Human-AI Collaboration** - Emphasis on augmenting human creativity rather than replacing it
4. **Lifestyle Integration** - AI systems help optimize personal and professional lifestyles

## E-commerce Implementation
The e-commerce functionality has been implemented with the following features:

1. **Printful Integration** - API endpoint (`/api/printful.js`) for connecting to Printful's drop shipping service
2. **Video Support** - Section for featuring promotional videos for merchandise
3. **AI Profit Optimizer** - Interactive AI assistant that provides profit optimization suggestions
4. **Product Showcase** - Display of AI-designed merchandise with detailed descriptions

### Printful Integration
The website includes a mock API endpoint (`/api/printful.js`) that simulates integration with Printful. In a production environment, this would be connected to the actual Printful API with proper authentication. The current implementation includes:

- GET endpoint to fetch products
- POST endpoint to create orders

### AI Profit Optimizer
The AI profit optimization feature is implemented through:

1. A floating button in the e-commerce page that opens the AI assistant
2. An API endpoint (`/api/ai-profit-optimizer.js`) that provides AI-generated suggestions
3. User interface for displaying and interacting with these suggestions

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **Navigation** (`components/Navigation.js`) - Reusable navigation component for consistent header across all pages
- **Layout** (implemented in `_app.js`) - Consistent layout with header and footer for all pages

### API Routes
- `/api/printful.js` - Handles product fetching and order creation for Printful integration
- `/api/ai-profit-optimizer.js` - Provides AI-generated profit optimization suggestions

- Primary color: #990000 (Red)
- Accent color: #D4AF37 (Gold)
- Background colors: White and various grays
- Text colors: Dark for readability, white for contrast on dark backgrounds

## Future Development Recommendations
